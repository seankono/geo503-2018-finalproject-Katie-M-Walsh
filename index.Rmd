# Materials and methods

Narrative and most code will go here.  Describe what you are doing and show how to do it (with code).



* Joining CUGIR elevation shapefiles
* Filtering elevations
* Filtering for precipitation
* Establishing Flood Zones in Seneca Nation
* Filtering by soil type
* Filtering by vegetation type
* Creating possible wetland areas by selection/joining of filtered topics 



See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.


Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
1+2
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
#library(spocc)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```


We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).

```{r, warning=F} 
## define which species to query
sp='Turdus migratorius'

## run the query and convert to data.frame()
#d = occ(query=sp, from='ebird',limit = 100) %>% occ2df()
```
This can take a few seconds.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map illustrating the known occurrence locations"}
# Load coastline
#map=map_data("world")

#ggplot(d,aes(x=longitude,y=latitude))+
#  geom_polygon(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),data=map)+
#  geom_point(col="red")+
#  coord_equal()
```


# Results

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

#```{r}
#hist(d$latitude)
#```

# Conclusions

What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?
